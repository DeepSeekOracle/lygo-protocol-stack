"""lygo.world — adapter over `src/world_clock.py`.

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MODULE-CORE-v1

M1 SHIM, BEHAVIOUR UNCHANGED: `GET /api/world` answers exactly what 1.1.1 answered — the bytes come
from the same `world_clock.pulse()` call the kernel used to make inline. Nothing here re-implements
the clock; if the clock changes, this module follows for free.

Read-only: the weather lookup caches in memory inside world_clock, so the module owns no state and
needs no gate. A network failure is already handled inside the clock (it returns the stamps without
weather), so this route does not fail when the laptop is offline.
