# LYGO SkillSpector v1.0.0

**Scan before you install — gate before you ship.**

Enhanced local risk scanner for OpenClaw/ClawHub skill packages. Successor surface to Skill Gate with **CI gate**, **batch**, **Markdown report**, and deeper rule pack (httpx, curl|bash, PowerShell IEX, miners, HF/OpenAI key shapes).

**Signature:** `Delta9Phi963-SKILL-SPECTOR-v1.0.0`  
**ClawHub:** `@deepseekoracle/lygo-skill-spector`

> **Builder version (full stack):** If you run a **full LYGO stack**, the unlocked **builder** pack (HTML multi-root reports, multi-gate CI matrix, dashboard JSON) is on  
> **[SkillHub FULL LYGO](https://chatagent.ca/lygoskillhub.html#full-lygo)**  
> as `lygo-skill-spector` FULL RAW (+ `builder/`).

## Dual channel

| Channel | What you get |
|---------|----------------|
| **ClawHub (public)** | `scan` · `gate` · `batch` · `report` · `self-demo` — tentacle |
| **SkillHub FULL** | Same + **builder/** HTML batch, multi-root gate, CI summary — unlocked RAW |

---

## Install (public)

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install deepseekoracle/lygo-skill-spector
```

FULL engineer RAW: https://chatagent.ca/lygoskillhub.html#full-lygo

---

## Commands

```bash
cd path/to/lygo-skill-spector
python scripts/self_check.py

# Scan one skill
python scripts/skill_spector.py scan "I:/E Drive/.grok/skills/lygo-context-guard"
python scripts/skill_spector.py scan lygo-ops-detector

# CI gate (exit non-zero if risk worse than max-band)
python scripts/skill_spector.py gate ./some-skill --max-band low

# Batch under a skills root
python scripts/skill_spector.py batch "I:/E Drive/.grok/skills"

# Markdown report
python scripts/skill_spector.py report ./some-skill
python scripts/skill_spector.py report ./some-skill --write last.md --i-consent

# Self-demo
python scripts/skill_spector.py self-demo
```

### FULL builder only (SkillHub)

```bash
python builder/skill_spector_builder.py html-batch ./skills --write batch.html --i-consent
python builder/skill_spector_builder.py multi-gate ./skills --max-band elevated
python builder/skill_spector_builder.py ci-summary ./skills --write ci.json --i-consent
```

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | clear / low (or under max-band) |
| 5 | elevated or claim mismatch |
| 10 | high / critical |
| 2 | bad path / not a skill |

## What it checks

- `subprocess` / `os.system` / `Popen` / `shell=True` / PowerShell `IEX`  
- HTTP clients (`urllib`, `requests`, `httpx`, `aiohttp`), sockets, webhooks  
- `curl|bash` / `wget|bash` remote-code patterns  
- `eval` / `exec`, pickle, unsafe yaml  
- Hardcoded key-like strings (incl. `sk-proj-`, `hf_`)  
- Destructive deletes, force-push, auto-publish / ClawHub publish hints  
- Crypto miner / keylogger-style signals  
- **Claim mismatch**: frontmatter says `network: false` but code uses HTTP  

**Does not:** download skills, install skills, execute scanned code, or phone home.

## Pair with

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| `lygo-skill-gate` | Lighter single-scan gate (still supported) |
| `lygo-context-guard` | Token budget + secret redact |
| `lygo-continuum` | Seal “scanned clean” as checkable claims |
| `lygo-kickstart-wizard` | Onboarding map |
