"""Does a picture the turn produced get named in the answer?

Row 76, measured live on 2026-09-21: the operator asked the API brain for a picture and the answer was
a promise - "I'll render it now - first run loads the checkpoint, so give it a minute." The limb did
produce a real PNG (23.6s, 957,430 bytes); the answer never said where it was. This asks the same thing
and insists the reply names a file that is really on disk.

Restores the console's config through atexit, so a crash on any step cannot leave it on a half-set
provider.
