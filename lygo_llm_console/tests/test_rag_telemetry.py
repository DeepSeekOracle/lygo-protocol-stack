"""The RAG has to be legible while it is working, or the operator cannot leave it alone.

The console injects recalled history into a turn on its own. When that happens invisibly, the only
signal the operator gets is a window percentage that looks like a fault - the conversation is eleven
times the budget, and nothing says the recall is why the turn still works. These tests pin the record
that makes the behaviour visible, and the rule that keeping it can never cost a turn.
