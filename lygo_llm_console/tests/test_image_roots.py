"""Image limb path policy: read through the mapped roots, never silently rewrite a path.

The bug this covers: image_info had its own private workspace guard. Given an absolute path outside
the kit it swapped in WORKSPACE/<name> and then answered "missing", so a real picture on another
drive (already mapped in workspace_map) looked absent. The model could only report that the file
does not exist - and with the LYGO ALIGN honesty rule that becomes "UNKNOWN (SHADOW) - the
specified image file path does not exist", repeated on every turn.

Rules under test:
- a workspace path keeps working (relative paths resolve under the workspace);
- a path outside every read root is refused WITH A REASON (outside_read_roots / denied_path), and
  never as a bare "missing" - the policy must be visible in the answer, not disguised as absence;
- a path inside a mapped read root resolves and reads (hermetic: the root is injected here).
