"""TEMPLATE - copy this to tests/test_<area>.py and fill it in.

Not collected by pytest on purpose (a leading underscore means "not a test file yet"), so this
template can sit in the suite without ever being run as one. Prove a copy works with:

    C:/Python313/python.exe tests/test_<area>.py          # runs the file on its own
    C:/Python313/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_<area>.py -q

WHAT A TEST IN THIS KIT PINS
    One rule, in the docstring, in the operator's words. If a later edit can break a promise the
    steward relied on (standalone, no daemon, a mapped read root, a license, an owned model), a test
    here is what makes that edit fail loudly instead of quietly changing behaviour. Name the rule in
    the assertion message: the failure has to read like a complaint, not like a diff.

THE FOUR RULES THIS KIT'S TESTS FOLLOW
    1. Never touch the network and never start a daemon. A test that needs a live engine is a
       different kind of test - put it in scripts/ as a runnable probe, not in tests/.
    2. Never write outside a temporary directory. Anything that writes (registry, save/, logs) is
       patched at the module constant it actually reads - see SandboxTests below.
    3. Never read or print a secret. Assert that a token file exists; do not open it.
    4. Read-only on the real machine. If the operator's real files matter (a picture, a file on a
       mapped root), assert on their *existence and handling*, never mutate them.
