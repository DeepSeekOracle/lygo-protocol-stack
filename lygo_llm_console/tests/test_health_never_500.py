"""The route the operator reads state from may degrade, never 500.

Measured on this tree 2026-09-21, two boots: `GET /api/health -> 500` once while the engine was still
loading (five polled 200s, one 500, then 200s again - the 500 body went to a startup poll that threw it
away) and once as the very last line the console logged before the process went away. The operator's own
console ended its log the same way at 00:16 that morning, which is why it read as "the console died".

The body carries the exception and the handler only sends it to a loopback caller, so neither cause was
ever readable. It does not need to be: the answer already advertises an `error` field, and every probe
that reads the machine (session state, drives, RAM, backend layer, perf, registry, cloud) is one call
away from raising on a box where the stick can be unplugged mid-read. A partial answer is what the
operator is looking at this route for.

So: one failing probe blanks its own field and is named in `degraded`; the route answers 200 either way.
