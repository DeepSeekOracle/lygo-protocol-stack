"""Retrieval quality: recall has to be worth trusting when nobody is watching it.

The console injects these passages into a turn on its own, so a bad ranking is not a cosmetic problem -
it spends the window on noise, and it does so exactly when the conversation is long enough that the
operator cannot check it. These tests pin the two ways that went wrong in live use:

* near-duplicate blocks filling the top-k (three copies of one message, nothing else)
* a common word in the query carrying a block that shares nothing else with it
