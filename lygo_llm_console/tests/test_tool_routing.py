"""Tool routing on the shipped local brain: the fix must stay fixed.

Measured before the fix (qwen2.5-coder:7b, ctx 8192): five of five arithmetic probes routed to
web_search/web_fetch and one answered 53 for 17 * 23. `calc` sat 18th of 20 in the local schema,
described only as "Evaluate a numeric Python expression", while the web tools came first.

These tests lock the two levers that were changed. They cannot prove routing (that needs a live
turn and is measured separately); they can prove the levers were not quietly reverted.
