"""Which kit is running the suite: the PC build or the stick copy?

Three assertions in this suite read the *shipped PC config* (``config/console.json``) or require a git
checkout above the kit. The stick carries a hand-kept portable profile and sits in no repository, so
those assertions cannot hold there - and a stick whose suite is red cannot be signed off. They are
skipped on removable media instead of being weakened: ``src/surface.py`` already answers the question
from the Windows volume type.
