"""The conversation has to flow past the window, and the detail has to come back by itself.

What this pins, in the operator's terms:

* a conversation that outgrows the window keeps going - nothing is refused, nothing is lost;
* a detail from earlier (or from an earlier session) is handed to the turn when the ask needs it,
  whether or not this turn happened to drop anything;
* what is injected still fits the window, because a recall that overflows the engine is worse than
  no recall at all;
* the index keeps itself current - nobody rebuilds it by hand;
* no match means silence, not noise.
