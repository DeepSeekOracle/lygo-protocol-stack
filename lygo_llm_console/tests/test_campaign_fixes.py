"""The defects the 2026-09-21 campaign found, held down as tests.

Each of these was measured on the running console or against the vendor's own endpoint; the numbers and
the raw rows are in docs/TEST_CAMPAIGN_2026-09-21.md and workspace/memory/test-campaign-*.jsonl.

  1. switching provider kept the previous provider's model, so every API turn came back 404
     ("The model `deepseek-chat` not found" from NVIDIA, Gemini and Groq alike);
  2. the local fallback then re-used that same foreign model, so the engine that was ready to answer
     could not be asked to - the operator was shown "API handoff" instead of an answer;
  3. a reasoning provider given a small output budget answered almost nothing ("GEM" for a request to
     say GEMINI OK) while a plain provider was fine;
  4. the volatile readout that rides the newest message came back inside the answer, so a reply of
     "LOCAL SIDE" was followed by the clock and the world line;
  5. a limb that failed was repeated by the model as the answer, so an internal Python message
     ("calc could not answer (invalid syntax ...)") was shown to the operator as if it were the reply.
