"""The evidence rules behind a fail-soft console: the reason must be true, and proof must be proof.

Both were wrong on this box on 2026-09-20 and both were found by reading the recorded reasons rather
than the code: ten models were filed "no_gpu_device" on a machine with an idle RTX 4060 Ti (the reading
came from our CPU-only base binary), and a fit verdict - arithmetic - was about to be accepted as proof
that the GPU had carried a turn (it had not; both GPU backends sat unproven).
