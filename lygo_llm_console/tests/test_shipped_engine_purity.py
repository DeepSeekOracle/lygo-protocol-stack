"""The shipped engine/ must stay CPU-pure, and every GPU dll must live in engine/backends/.

Why this is a test and not a note: a GPU ggml dll sitting beside the shipped llama-server once
crashed every model load on this host inside the vendor driver (nvoglv64.dll, 0xc0000005, at any
-ngl, including 0). A stick that must boot on ANY PC cannot afford that — GPU code is opt-in, it
lives in the backend store, and it is only activated after a self-test loads a real model with it.
