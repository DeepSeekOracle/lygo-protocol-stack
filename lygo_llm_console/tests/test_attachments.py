"""Attachments: a photo or a file the operator picks has to reach the agent.

Two ways in, and each needs a different path to work:

  * img  - the picture rides the message itself as an ``image_url`` part, which the engine's own
           projector reads (llama-server --mmproj). No limb call, nothing to lose between turns.
  * file - text is inlined into the message; anything else is written under ``workspace/uploads/`` so
           the agent opens it with ``read_file``. That path MUST sit in a root its own limbs cover, or
           the button hands the agent a file it cannot read.

Both used to fail silently: the picker held the file with no sign of it on screen, a photo over 4 MB was
refused by the chat body limit as a silent 413, and a picture attached as a *file* was a bare path with no
limb in the local schema able to look at it.
