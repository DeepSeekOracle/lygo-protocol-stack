"""A turn that asks for nothing must be answered, not recited to - and nothing the console says to the
model may leak into the record of what the operator said.

Measured on the live console 2026-09-21 09:25 (this box, qwen2.5-coder:7b, cuda), session holding a
greeting the console had ALREADY answered with the clock - the operator's own condition after asking
"heloo?":

    newest text   shipped tail                                        3 x 4 reps
    "hi"          one clock recital behind the history                7 of 12 answers were an answer
    "thanks"      "Understood. The current time is UTC 2026-09-21T..."   - 2 recited the clock back
                  "Understood. Let's proceed with your instructions."      - 2 answered the instructions
    "you there?"  "Yes, I'm here.  NOW: - UTC: 2026-09-21T15:25:10..."     - 1 recited the clock

The volatile tail rides the newest message, so on a turn that asks nothing the model had a clock in
front of it and nothing to do with it: it handed the clock back. Given the same turns with a
conversational directive on the newest message instead: 12 of 12 answered as a person ("Hello! How can
I assist you today?"). Withholding the clock on such a turn as well measured the same 12 of 12, so the
directive is the fix and the clock is a guard that costs nothing - it cannot be recited if it is never
sent. Both live in this file's subjects; the wording of neither is an order, because a bare imperative
under a greeting is what produced the first defect (see tests/test_continuity.py).
