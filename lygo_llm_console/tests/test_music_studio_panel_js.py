"""The song studio panel's own assertions, run under node: the half of the studio no Python test sees.

The panel decides what the operator is told, and it is where a finished song was reported as "nothing
here is claimed as finished" — its fixtures carried the song as an object while the server sends a
path string, so the panel's `j.song.name` was always undefined. The harness now feeds the real wire
shapes, and it goes red on the old logic (verified: 5 failures).

Skipped, not failed, where node is not installed: this kit runs without it.
