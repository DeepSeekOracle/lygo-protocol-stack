"""Guards on the config-path repair.

repair_paths rewrites drive-anchored roots in config/admin.json when the kit moves. Two ways it
used to damage a copy, both silent, both covered here:

1. It remapped any origin-drive path to {drive} without checking that the result exists, so a hub
   on D: got D:\\E Drive\\LYRA LOCAL while the real folder stayed on I: - a read root that resolves
   nowhere and simply yields no files.
2. On a second pass the stamped origin drive becomes the kit's own drive, at which point every
   path on it looks like an origin path: C:\\Users\\<user>\\Pictures was rewritten to
   {drive}:\\Users\\<user>\\Pictures - a path that exists but is not what the steward configured.

Both must be refused while genuine kit-owned paths still move.
