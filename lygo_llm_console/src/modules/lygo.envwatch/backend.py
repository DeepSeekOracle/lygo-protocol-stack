"""lygo.envwatch — what needs fixing, in one card.

The pair to `lygo.llminfo`. That module answers *what is hooked up*; this one answers *what needs
fixing*: skill files that never reach the model, mapped paths that do not resolve, error lines the
console wrote in the background, and the daemons this kit runs and watches.

Three rules shape every line of this file:

1. **A finding is a fact with a location.** Every issue carries what, why and *where* (a path, a
   file, a log line). A panel that says "problems found" without a location is noise.
2. **A search that did not run is reported UNCHECKED, never folded into "fine".** Each collector
   says which checks it actually ran; if an owner will not import, the group says so by name.
3. **The search is stated.** `nothing needs fixing` is a claim about a named search — the panel
   prints its log rule table and how many checks ran, so the operator can audit the claim instead of
   trusting it. Green from a check that never ran is the one lie this module may not tell.

It owns no state, writes nothing, gates nothing and **fixes nothing**: a watcher that also repaired
would hide the thing it found.
