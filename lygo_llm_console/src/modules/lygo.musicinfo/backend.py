"""lygo.musicinfo — what this console can sing, in one card.

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MUSICINFO-v1

WHAT THIS ANSWERS
    The third of the making cards, beside the picture engine and the voice engine: **what can this
    machine make a song WITH, and what did it last make?** Two questions the operator could not
    answer anywhere in one place:

        the engine      which music engine this tree reaches, where its install is, whether its own
                        entry script and its own python are there
        its weights     every declared weight file, by name and by size, or the names of the ones
                        that are not on disk
        the route       which route a song would take right now (card free, or offload), and where
                        the finished song lands
        the last song   the newest song this kit really wrote, with what it recorded about itself

WHY IT EXISTS AS A CARD AND NOT A LIMB
    The limb (`music_generate`) makes a song; this card is the read-out that says whether a song is
    possible BEFORE one is asked for, and whether the last one is really on disk. An operator who
    asks for a song on a machine with no weights should learn that from a card, not from a failure.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
    * No new state and no writes anywhere: `owns: []`, `gate: none`, and its own test scans this
      file for write calls. The songs it reports on were written by the limb.
    * No re-derivation. The engine, the weights, the route and the last song are all asked of their
      owner (`music_tools`) - this card prints what it is told and invents nothing.
    * No claim that a song was made when none was. "No song rendered yet on this kit" is a TRUE
      fact on a fresh kit and stays green, exactly as an empty vault does on the memory card.
    * A weight file that is declared and absent is reported as ABSENT WITH ITS NAME, never as ready
      and never folded into a percentage that reads as fine.

THE HONESTY RULES IT INHERITS
    * A check that could not run is named in `missing` and drags the card off green.
    * The card never reaches into the engine's own folders to write, clean or repair.
