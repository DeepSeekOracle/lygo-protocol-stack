"""lygo.delegatectrl - the side-agent buttons: which free engines answer, and one task handed out.

\u03949\u03a6963-LYGO-DELEGATECTRL-v1

WHAT THIS IS
    The card and the buttons for the side-agent pair that lives in `delegate_tools` - `subagent_run`
    and `subagent_pool` - which are ALREADY registered as limbs in limbs.py. So this module registers
    no limb and declares none: every call goes through the same two functions the brain's own tools
    call, which is what stops a button and the agent disagreeing about what happened.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
    * It will not call the pool available because the roster lists it. `Probe pool` asks each engine
      to answer once, and the card reads "not checked" until it has. Only the button spends a request.
    * It will not spend one at boot: `health` is a local read, so a console start never pays for a
      metered service and never waits on a socket.
    * It will not turn a masked error into a diagnosis. "Unexpected server error" is reported as
      that, with its ref, never as "the model is down" - the pool, a rate limit, a retired model id
      and a broken directory all look identical from here.
    * It will not hand private operator context to a free tier, whose per-model data terms differ.
      The card says so where the operator reads it, next to the button that would do it.
    * It will not claim the switch worked. `brain_on` re-reads `cloud_api.public_status()` after the
      save and reports the provider, model and url it actually found there.

THE SWITCH - the console's own turns, on the free pool
    `Use free brain` points the console's brain (not a side task: the turns YOU send) at the free
    model pool. It rides cloud_api's existing `custom` row - "OpenAI-compatible URL" - pointed at
    the in-process adapter in `free_brain`, which answers each turn by driving the OpenCode CLI,
    the one client the free tier accepts. No core file changes and no new brain path exists.
    `Back to paid / local` restores the provider, model and enabled flag that were there before
    (snapshotted at switch time) and then stops the adapter.
    A turn on the free brain SPAWNS THE CLI: seconds per answer, no token streaming, metered by
    the free tier and masked when exhausted. That is stated on the card, not buried here.
