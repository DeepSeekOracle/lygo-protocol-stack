"""Task queue and worker: work that outlives the turn that asked for it.

Ported in spirit from the Hermes agent loop's liveness family (`turn_liveness.py`, `deadline.py`,
`estop.py`): a long job must not hold the conversation hostage, and a job that stops making
progress must be *visible* as stalled rather than looking busy forever.

Properties this module guarantees
---------------------------------
- `add()` returns immediately, with an id. The agent never waits on the queue.
- One daemon worker runs jobs in order, heart-beating while it works, so a stalled job can be told
  apart from a slow one.
- Every task carries a deadline. Past it, a running task is reported `stalled` and the queue moves
  on - the console cannot be wedged by one job.
- State lives in a JSONL event log (`data/tasks.jsonl`), so the record survives a restart and the
  operator can read what happened without asking the process.

A job is a limb call (`task_add target=self_test args={}`), never a command line: the limb's own
guards and consent rules still apply.
