"""Conversation compaction: a small live window, a complete record.

The problem this solves: an engine has one fixed context window, and a chat that outgrows it loses the
oldest turns silently. Three separate throttles used to cut the record - the portal sent only its last
24 messages, `trim_history()` capped history at 9,000 characters, and `save_session()` kept only the
last 40 messages on disk. Anything older than that was gone: not summarised, not archived, gone.

This module keeps three tiers instead of a cliff:

* **T1 journal** - `save/sessions/journal-<sid>.jsonl`, append-only, one JSON line per message, verbatim,
  stamped with both a unix time and a readable local time. Every turn goes in. Nothing is ever trimmed
  out of it, so the transcript of record is complete regardless of what the engine sees.
* **T2 rollups** - `save/sessions/rollups/<sid>-NNNN.json` + `.md`. When turns leave the live window
  they are folded into a deterministic digest: per turn, its stamp, its role, its opening text, and the
  paths/URLs/tools it touched. No model call, so compaction can never stall a turn, hallucinate a
  fact, or enter a summarise-the-summary drift loop. `carry_over()` returns the bounded block of the
  newest rollups that goes into the system prompt, so the model always knows what was said before.
* **T3 archive** - `save/archive/<sid>.zip` + `save/archive/index.jsonl`. A sealed session (journal,
  rollups, readable transcript, manifest with hashes) is compressed and indexed once the conversation
  is done or the journal passes its size/turn cap. `recall()` searches the live journal *and* the
  archives, so any turn can be pulled back verbatim on demand - which is what makes a huge context
  window unnecessary rather than merely unaffordable.

Design rules, each one learned the hard way elsewhere in this kit:

* **No stall is allowed.** Compaction is deterministic and bounded; it never calls the engine. A turn
  that overflows triggers `compact()` before the prompt is built, and that call is cheap enough to sit
  inside a request.
* **Nothing raises into a request handler.** Every entry point is wrapped: a compaction failure must
  cost a digest, never a turn. Callers use `safe_*` helpers.
* **Idempotent.** `covered_upto` records how far the rollups have folded the journal, so re-running
  compaction rewrites nothing and never double-counts.
* **Writes are atomic and unique-temp** (`atomicio.atomic_write_text`), because a fixed `.tmp` name is
  what killed this console under two concurrent readers.
* **Verify before delete.** A sealed zip is read back (`testzip()` + journal hash) before the live
  journal is trimmed; an archive is never the only copy of something that has been discarded.
