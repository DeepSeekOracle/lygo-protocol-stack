"""lygo.health — adapter over the kernel's own status facts.

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MODULE-CORE-v1

M1 BEHAVIOUR: this module owns no HTTP route on purpose (see module.json `notes`). It answers the
question "is this console healthy, and on which edition?" from facts the kernel already publishes,
and it is the module every other module's health is read next to in /api/modules.

No state, no network, no engine: this adapter is safe to call at any time, including during boot.
