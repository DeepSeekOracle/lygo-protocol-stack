"""lygo.meminfo — what this console remembers, in one card.

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MEMINFO-v1

WHAT THIS ANSWERS
    One question the operator cannot answer anywhere else in one place: **what do you still have,
    and what was thrown away?** A console keeps its memory in five stores, and until now each was
    reachable only by a different route or not at all:

        the live journal     save/sessions/journal-<id>.jsonl     this session, verbatim
        the window record    save/sessions/compaction_state.json  what was folded into digests
        the vault            save/vault/<year>/<month>/<slug>/    every finished chat, filed
        the sealed archive   save/archive/index.jsonl + *.zip     what a recall can search
        the event journal    save/mycelium/events.jsonl           the kit's own receipt trail

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
    * No new state and no writes anywhere: a read-out. `owns: []`, `gate: none`, and the module's
      own test scans this file for write calls.
    * No duplicated kernel logic. Every number is asked of its owner — `compaction` for the record
      and the archive, `sessions` for the vault, `paths` for where things live. The live token
      budget and the model's context window belong to **LLM data** (`lygo.llminfo`); this card
      NAMES that owner instead of printing a second copy that can drift out of step.
    * No store reported as empty that was not read. An unread store is UNCHECKED and named; only a
      store actually read may report zero.

THE HONESTY RULES IT INHERITS
    * A check that could not run is named in words and drags the card off green — never folded
      into green.
    * A store that really is empty is a TRUE FACT, not a gap: a fresh kit with an empty vault reads
      "nothing sealed yet" and stays green.
    * It prints the rule table it counted by, so "nothing was lost" is a claim about a named search
      and not a feeling.
