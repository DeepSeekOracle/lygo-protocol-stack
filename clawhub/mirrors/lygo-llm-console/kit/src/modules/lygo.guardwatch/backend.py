"""lygo.guardwatch — who could read something they must not?

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-GUARDWATCH-v1

A finder (family "watch"). It answers one question in one place, and it goes amber or red only when
something really is wrong: **is anything readable here that should not be?**

WHAT IT CHECKS
    A. Every credential pointer in `config/admin.json → credential_pointers` — does it resolve, does
       it sit inside the kit, does it sit inside any root a limb may open, and does the kernel's own
       deny rule actually cover it?
    B. Secret-shaped FILES inside the kit tree — and for each one, whether `.gitignore` covers it,
       because a key in the tree that git would commit ships to a public repo.
    C. Secret-shaped files inside the read roots a limb may open, bounded and with the budget stated.
    D. The kit's own declared runtime keys: present, declared, git-ignored.
    E. Does any git remote URL carry a credential in it?

THE ONE RULE IT MAY NEVER BREAK
    **It never opens a credential file.** It stats, it resolves, it compares paths — it never reads a
    byte of one, and it never prints a secret. The direct consequence is stated in `missing[]` every
    time: a secret sitting inside a file whose NAME looks ordinary cannot be found by this card,
    because finding it would mean reading the file.

WHY IT ASKS INSTEAD OF RE-DERIVING
    The kernel already owns the answer to "may this path be touched": `tools._denied(resolved_path)`
    resolves a path to its real form first (so a short name, a junction or a mapped letter cannot slip
    past it) and denies the credential directories outright. This card CALLS that, and names it in
    `sources[]`, rather than keeping a second copy of the deny list that could drift out of step with
    the one actually enforced. Same for the pointers (`admin_map.credential_pointers()`), the roots
    (`admin_map.read_roots()`) and the drives (`admin_map.drives()`).

    It owns no state, writes nothing and fixes nothing — the owner of a thing fixes the thing. Its
    own test scans this file for write calls.
