"""The one place this kit's release number lives.

Every move forward is a real version change: bump ``VERSION`` and the console header, ``/api/health`` and
the runtime facts the model is told all follow in the same second - there is no second string to forget.

Why this file exists: the release used to be stamped in THREE places - ``server.BUILD``
(``v1.1-20260917api2``), ``runtime_facts._FALLBACK_BUILD`` (the same string again) and the portal's own
``LYGO_BUILD`` const (``1.1.0``) - so the header, the health line and the facts handed to the model could
disagree about which build the operator was running, and a version bump was three edits that had to be
remembered together.

``VERSION`` holds the release on line 1 and an optional tag on line 2::

    1.1.0
    stable-anchor 2026-09-19

Everything here is read-only and cheap: the file is parsed on each call (a few hundred bytes) so a bump
needs no restart of an import cache.
