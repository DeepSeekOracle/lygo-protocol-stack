"""Forever history: every conversation the console has, filed on disk, nothing asked of the model.

The operator's words: "I want Conversations to flow unlimited ... CREATE A simple system that SAVES
the whole conversation window, all text into a folder inside the console ... this will be the forever
history of full conversations ... a program that doesnt bother the AI ... triggered after the COMPLETE
response ... so we dont duplicate saves we can simply save responses from AI and sent text from the
user ... if the AI needs to see previous history its all there".

How it holds those promises
---------------------------
* **Off the hot path.** `sync()` only decides *what* is new and hands the text to a background writer
  thread. A slow, full or un-writable disk costs the turn nothing, and no failure here can raise into
  an answer - a broken archive must never break the console.
* **Never twice.** The console re-persists its whole session every turn, so filing cannot be driven by
  "on save" - and it cannot be driven by counting either, because the console TRIMS an over-long
  conversation before sending it and the window slides. A message is recognised by what it says, not by
  where it sits, and what is already filed is remembered from the blocks in the file itself, so a
  restart, a crash, a replayed turn or a slid window still files each message exactly once.
* **The sent text when it is sent; the answer when it is complete.** A payload that ends with the
  steward's message files that message. The agent's text is only ever filed when it arrives as part of
  a completed turn - a half-streamed answer is not history.
* **Verbatim.** No truncation, no summarising, no stripping: what was said is what is kept, newlines
  and fences intact.
* **Labelled.** Every block names who spoke, the turn number, whether it was sent or complete, and the
  model that answered. A `INDEX.md` carries one grep-able line per block so the agent can find a past
  conversation without loading any of them.

Layout:  <workspace>/memory/conversations/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HHMMSS>-lygo-<session8>.md   (+ INDEX.md)
Reader:  the files are plain markdown under the workspace, so the agent's existing read_file /
         list_dir / search_corpus limbs already read them. `scripts/read_history.py` is a convenience
         front end. `src/lygo_rag.py` searches the same history by meaning-of-words.
