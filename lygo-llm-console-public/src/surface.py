"""One console, three systems - named, and measured rather than assumed.

The console is the same code in all three; what differs is where the kit lives and what answers:

    usb_local   "USB LOCAL"               kit on removable media - the stick's own CPU-proven engine
                                          answers, and the API boosts it when a host or a question
                                          needs more. Boots on any PC it is plugged into.
    pc_local    "PC LOCAL"                kit on a fixed disk - the host's GPU/CPU engine answers
                                          (much faster), with the same API boost on demand.
    api_only    "WEB PORTAL (API ONLY)"   nothing local answers: the online API does, through the
                                          public web portal. No engine, no disks, no local models.

What each one *is* - the operator's own definition, quoted on every surface:

    USB LOCAL   stand-alone agent - everything onboard the stick: plug it in and go, and it is
                mobile (one stick, carried between PCs)
    PC LOCAL    the full admin console on this PC - this is the build that becomes the public
                version
    WEB PORTAL  the internet portal, API-only: already built, an easy API agent page anyone can
                use online

The label is read from the machine, never guessed:
  * media comes from the Windows volume type of the kit's drive (REMOVABLE vs FIXED). A stick whose
    bridge reports itself as a fixed disk can be declared with LYGO_SURFACE=usb - a declaration
    always wins over the probe.
  * which system is answering *now* comes from what actually booted: a local engine that is ready
    means a LOCAL system belongs to usb/pc; no local engine means the API-only portal system.
