"""LYGO Perf — host-adaptive launch profile for the engine.

One stick, many hosts. This module decides where the weights actually run: as many
layers as the host GPU can hold, on every CPU core the host offers, or honestly on
CPU alone when the engine build has no GPU backend at all.

Contract:
- the kit config is the operator's word. An integer ngl/threads is a PIN and is
  honored exactly as written, 0 included. The token "auto" (or a missing key) hands
  the decision to this module.
- a GPU is only claimed when it is proven: the engine build must ship a backend DLL
  and the engine's own --list-devices must name a device. No proof, no claim.
- every outcome is remembered per host + model in data/perf.json, so the next boot on
  that host starts where it last succeeded instead of spending its time again.

Placement changes speed only. Weights, precision and semantics never change here.
