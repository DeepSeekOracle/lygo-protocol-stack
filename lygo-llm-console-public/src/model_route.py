"""Route a turn to something that can actually take it - and name the RIG when nothing can.

The console must never be the thing that fails. Three rules, in this order:

1. SEE everything. Every model on every drive stays in the list even when this machine cannot run it.
2. ATTEMPT, then fail SOFT. A model that will not boot produces a named rig limit (`class: "rig"`) with
   the reason and the arithmetic, never a stack trace and never a dead console. The engine keeps
   running, the session survives, and the operator picks another route.
3. TASK to the best model that CAN take it. Asked for a picture, route to a model with a projector, or
   to a cloud route whose provider accepts images - never to a text model that will answer about a
   photo it never saw.

The API brains are first-class routes, not a fallback shame: the local model is one part of the build,
and a hosted model that accepts an image outranks a local one that cannot. Caps come from measurement
(save/model_check.json, written by model_check.py) for local models and from the provider's published
capabilities for cloud routes - every cloud cap carries its source URL, and an unknown one says unknown
rather than guessing.
