"""The song studio's engine room: one render at a time, a cancel that really stops it.

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MUSIC-JOBS-v1

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The music limb is synchronous: it renders a song and only then answers. That is right for a call
    the brain makes inside a turn, and wrong for a studio panel, where a render runs for tens of
    minutes and the operator must be able to watch it, leave it, and stop it. This module turns a
    render into a JOB: a record on disk, a worker thread, a status line, and a cancel that kills the
    engine process.

WHAT IT OWNS
    `save/music/` - the engine choice the operator picked, and one file per job. Writes go through
    atomicio. Nothing here writes a song: the songs belong to `music_tools` (workspace/audio/songs).

HONESTY RULES BAKED IN
    - A job whose worker is gone is reported `interrupted`, never left reading `running` forever.
    - A render that has produced no engine output for a while says so out loud in its status line.
    - A cancel is recorded as `cancelled` only after the engine process is really dead.
    - Nothing here invents progress: the status line is either the engine's own last line or the
      limb's own named failure.

STANDING LAW THIS RESPECTS
    One engine at a time on an 8 GB card: `start` refuses while another job is running (by name),
    and the route decision lives in `music_tools.route_for_a_song`.
