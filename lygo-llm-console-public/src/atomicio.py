"""Atomic file writes that survive a stick.

Why this module exists: a fixed temp name (foo.json.tmp) collides when two request threads
write the same file at once, and on removable media antivirus / the search indexer can hold
the target open for a moment. os.replace then fails with PermissionError [WinError 32] and
the exception lands inside a request handler. So: one unique temp name per write, fsync, and
a short retry loop on the swap, and a last-resort in-place write that opens the target with
read+write+delete sharing, so a reader pinning it (Windows gives us no FILE_SHARE_DELETE from
plain open()) is never the one that gets denied. Reads go through read_text() for the same
reason: the OS denies an open() for a moment while a writer swaps the file, and a console
refresh must not answer 500.
