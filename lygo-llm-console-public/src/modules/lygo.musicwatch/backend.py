"""lygo.musicwatch — a finder over the music limb: the faults, named with their remedy.

Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MUSICWATCH-v1

WHAT THIS IS
    The watch half of the song-making pair. `lygo.musicinfo` reports the facts; this card reports
    the FAULTS - the things that are wrong, missing, half-wired or quietly lying about a song. It
    answers one question: **if the operator asks this console for a song right now, what will stop
    it, and what exactly is missing?**

THE CHECKS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS HERE
    engine      the app directory resolves at all (no engine means no song, and the search order is
                printed with the finding)
    entry       the server this limb drives is a real file - not the broken `infer.py` CLI
    python      the app's own virtualenv interpreter is on disk
    weights     every declared weight file, by name: a stage-1 transformer or the xcodec codec that
                is absent is named with the folder it belongs in, because fetching it is the fix
    cache       the model cache the weights are resolved from
    callable    THE CHECK THAT MATTERS MOST, and the one no human can see: a limb that is
                implemented and dispatchable but missing from `tools.CORE_NAMES` is invisible to the
                console's own brain, which will answer "I have no music tool" while the source says
                otherwise. This asks `tools.core_schema()` the question the local model is asked.
    dispatch    the limb name really has a branch in the dispatcher (a source-level check, because
                calling it to find out would render a song)
    output      the folder songs land in is writable - a render that dies at the copy step is a
                whole song thrown away
    audio tools ffprobe for a song's real duration, ffmpeg for conversion
    listening   nothing left listening: a previous render's engine server still holding a port is a
                finding, because this console's rule is that a job leaves no daemon behind
    dead runs   a run folder with an engine log and no audio file: the last error line from that log
                is printed, so a failed render cannot be mistaken for a slow one

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
    * It fixes nothing. It downloads nothing, deletes nothing, starts nothing: `owns: []`,
      `gate: none`, and its own test scans this file for write and spawn calls - the one subprocess
      it runs is a read-only process listing, and a listing that cannot run is UNCHECKED, never green.
    * It re-derives nothing. The engine resolution, the declared weights and the missing names come
      from `music_tools`; this card judges what it is handed.

GREEN MEANS EVERY CHECK RAN AND FOUND NOTHING. A check that could not run is named in `unchecked`
and drags the card to amber, because "I could not look" is not "it is fine".
