"""One place that knows how to refuse a request body (defect 27, 2026-09-20).

A server that refuses an oversized body and closes without reading it resets whatever the caller is
still writing, so the caller loses the answer: the console's `/api/session` answered 413 while 600 kB
was in flight, and the caller got a network error instead of the reason. The portal's own paste path
would have shown the operator "the network is down" for a paste that was merely too large.

Both HTTP surfaces here refuse bodies — the kernel in `server.py` and the internet-facing
`public_gateway.py` — so the policy lives here instead of twice with two sets of numbers that could
drift apart.

Bounded twice, because a declared Content-Length is the caller's word and not ours:

* `CAP` bytes are discarded at most, so a caller who declares 100 GB does not cost us 100 GB;
* `TIMEOUT` seconds are spent waiting for what has not arrived yet, so a caller cannot park a
  handler thread by declaring a body and then never sending it.
