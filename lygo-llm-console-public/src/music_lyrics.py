"""Δ9Φ963-LYGO-MUSIC-LYRICS-v1 - what the operator typed, turned into the sections an engine sings.

YuE does not take a block of text. Its own `split_lyrics()` matches `r"\\[(\\w+)\\](.*?)\\n(?=\\[|\\Z)"`
and generates ONE SECTION PER `[tag]` MARKER: `run_n_segments = min(run_n_segments, len(sections))`.
Plain lyrics therefore yield ZERO sections and a "full song" request renders NOTHING - which is why a
paragraph of words produced either silence or a single fragment. This module is the missing half: it
keeps whatever structure the operator wrote, gives plain words a structure taken from their own stanzas,
and says how many sections - i.e. how much song - that means.

It is deliberately engine-neutral: ACE-Step takes the same `[verse] / [chorus]` shape, so one system
feeds both engines and the operator writes their words once.

Honesty rules kept here:
  * The operator's own tags win. Nothing is retagged behind their back.
  * Grouping plain lyrics is REPORTED (`tagged: False` plus a note), never presented as their choice.
  * The section count is the song's length, so it is stated in seconds as well as sections.

    One source of truth, deliberately. The plan is what the estimate line counts, so building the
    payload anywhere else is how the two drift apart - and an earlier payload builder did drift: it
    recognised only bare `[verse]`-style tags, so a sheet written `[VERSE 1]` fell through to the
    untagged path and those tags would have been SUNG as lyrics. Comments are stripped, numbered
    tags fold onto their plain form, and the text ends in one newline so the closing section is not
    swallowed by the engine's own `(?=\[|\Z)` lookahead.
